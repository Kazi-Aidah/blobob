# blobob theme
An animated theme for Obsidian!
![](assets/screenshot-HQ.png)

As a self-taught animator of 7 years, I love seeing motion in interactions.
Since Obsidian is a huge part of my life, I wanted to make it more fun for me (and others).

It supports [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings#obsidian-style-settings-plugin) for lots of customization. Blobob Theme is currently in development, so if you find issues or want features or more styles, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/Kazi-Aidah/blobob/issues).

> I'd recommend trying this theme out without reading the rest of the README for surprises.
> THERE ARE 40+ COLOR THEMES INSIDE ( ≧ᗜ≦ )

## Animated Tabs

I personally have `Alt + <` and `Alt + >` for easy tab navigation.

## Tab Bar
| ![](assets/tab-bar-left.png) | ![](assets/tab-bar-right.png) |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |

**Left:** Fixed stack tabs button along with the left sidebar button (which moves into the sidebar when active).

**Right:** Fixed + Add Tab button & right sidebar button, custom mix-max-close buttons.

Design Idea: Essential buttons should stay fixed.

### Pinned Tabs

Design idea: Sharp when active, darkened and standing down when inactive (like bodyguards).

## Callout Style

## Why is the theme named ***blobob***?

I drew **Blob** a long time ago as a simple character concept.

At one point, I planned to turn it into a small animated task-reminder app using Rive, but the idea never went further. The character stayed with me, though.

In the theme, the main face you see is the yellow character I named **Bob**:

**Blob** is the original concept, **Bob** is the face used in the theme. 
Together, they became **blobob**.
